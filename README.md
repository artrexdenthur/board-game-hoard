# Board Game Hoard
## Description
This is a gem for the Flatiron Learn Module 2 (Sinatra) Project.
It hosts a Sinatra web app which allows a user to sign up and use CRUD methods on a personal collection of board games (persisted to a database). Users can also view other users' collections, but cannot edit them.

## Installation

If you want to host it yourself for development, you'll need at least a basic ruby environment set up. Then:
`git clone https://github.com/artrexdenthur/board-game-hoard.git`
`gem install bundler`
`bundle install`
`shotgun`

And then take your favorite web browser to http://127.0.0.1:9393
